			right and left brain web development sparks imagination and ignites curiosity.

			My past business was called "Tree of Life". As with the seasons, life changes. Right now, I am in a winter phase
			with creating a new identity for myself in technology. But I know that spring will come again.

		Weekly Reflections
	</h2>
	<h3>
		Week 1
	</h3>
		<p>
			I have done things this week I never would have dreamed of doing a week ago. I have moments of complete and utter
			confusion, but then I have been able to accomplish some of the tasks that I thought were completely impossible in the pre-work.
			Most specifically, I have a good understanding of HTML. I still have a lot to learn- especially about CSS and Java-
			but I plan on giving myself the space to be a student again and taking care of myself so that I can learn all the things
			I have been dreaming about learning. It is tedious, but the moment the "brain light" goes on, I am reminded of the day
			I taught my son how to read- he jumped up and down with such joy and flew into my arms saying "Thank you mama!" If we can learn
			how to read at the age of 5, surely we can learn to code at the age of 40. It just takes repitition, and determination.
			<em>I CAN DO THIS!</em>
		</p>
	<h3>
		Week 2
	</h3>
		<p>
			Week 2 was very difficult. I found myself completely lost in the lectures and then the activities were completely
			new to me. I slept very poorly this week, and I felt exhausted and overwhelmed in class. I still showed up every day
			even though I didn't really feel like it. Today, we start week 3, and I am still here. I will still do my part to show
			up every day and do my best. I finished the assignment on Object Oriented Programming, and it successfully deployed.
			So... today I end with a success.
		</p>
	<h3>
		Week 3
	</h3>
		<p>
			This week we played a game called "Forbidden Island"- it is the first time I have played a game where you are not
			meant to compete against each other- but rather work together to collect items and get each other off the island
			before the island sunk. At first, my competitive spirit came out, and I think we all started playing the game thinking
			we were playing against each other. Once we realized the goal of the game, we started doing really well. There is no way
			you can "win" this game unless everyone wins. What a unique concept- perhaps being a solo-preneur for so long, I have
			lost touch with what it is like to be on a team again. It is a remarkable feeling to know how much more a team can
			accomplish together vs. what we can accomplish alone, and I really look forward to working on team projects in the future.
			Everyone in my group is very hard working, and we are all doing are best with the talents that we have. Not one of us
			has the same strength, but together, I think we will make a truly outstanding capstone project.
