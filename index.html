		Weekly Reflections
	</h2>
	<h3>
		Week 1
	</h3>
		<p>
			I have done things this week I never would have dreamed of doing a week ago. I have moments of complete and utter
			confusion, but then I have been able to accomplish some of the tasks that I thought were completely impossible in the pre-work.
			Most specifically, I have a good understanding of HTML. I still have a lot to learn- especially about CSS and Java-
			but I plan on giving myself the space to be a student again and taking care of myself so that I can learn all the things
			I have been dreaming about learning. It is tedious, but the moment the "brain light" goes on, I am reminded of the day
			I taught my son how to read- he jumped up and down with such joy and flew into my arms saying "Thank you mama!" If we can learn
			how to read at the age of 5, surely we can learn to code at the age of 40. It just takes repitition, and determination.
			<em>I CAN DO THIS!</em>
